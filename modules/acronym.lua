local notice = [["Lua" (pronounced LOO-ah) means "Moon" in Portuguese. As such, it is neither an acronym nor an abbreviation, but a noun. More specifically, "Lua" is a name, the name of the Earth's moon and the name of the language. Like most names, it should be written in lower case with an initial capital, that is, "Lua". **Please do not write it as "LUA"**, which is both ugly and confusing, because then it becomes an acronym with different meanings for different people. So, please, write "Lua" right! - https://www.lua.org/about.html]]
