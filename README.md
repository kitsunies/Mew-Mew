# Mew-Mew

> **[Discord](https://discordapp.com)** Bot written in Lua, using the **[Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia)** API library and **[Luvit](https://luvit.io/)** runtime environment.

Mew-Mew is a private bot that I intended for use in [Rodev's](http://discord.gg/rodevs), a discord server revolving around Roblox development. After it was not being accepted into the server, I've decided to open-source it under the [LGPL license](LICENSE) for reference or academic and didactic purposes. 

<!-- This bot no longer uses luna's loader.
This bot heavily references Sinister Rectus' [Luna](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Luna) bot.

<!-- Ehh, i'll add this section in later...
