# Mew-Mew

Mew-Mew is a private bot that I intended for use in [Rodev's](http://discord.gg/rodevs), a discord server revolving around Roblox development. After it was not being accepted into the  server, I've decided to open-source it under the [LGPL license](LICENSE) for reference or academic and didactic purposes. 

This bot heavily references Sinister Rectus' [Luna](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Luna) bot.
